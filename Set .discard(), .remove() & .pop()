Explanation

After completing these  operations on the set, we get set. Hence, the sum is .

Note: Convert the elements of set s to integers while you are assigning them. To ensure the proper input of the set, we have added the first two lines of code to the editor.



Solution:



n = int(input())
s = set(map(int, input().split()))
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    string=input().split()
    if(string[0]=='pop'):
        s.pop()
    if(string[0]=='discard'):
        s.discard(int(string[1]))
    if(string[0]=='remove'):
        s.remove(int(string[1])) 
sum=0
for i in s:
    sum=sum+i;

print(sum)
